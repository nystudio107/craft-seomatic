# SEOmatic Overview

SEOmatic facilitates [modern SEO best practices](https://nystudio107.com/blog/modern-seo-snake-oil-vs-substance) & implementation for Craft CMS 3. It is a turnkey SEO system that is comprehensive, powerful, and flexible.

SEOmatic allows you to quickly get a site up and running with a robust, comprehensive SEO strategy.  It is also implemented in a Craft-y way, in that it is also flexible and customizable.

It implements [JSON-LD](https://developers.google.com/schemas/formats/json-ld?hl=en) microdata, [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview) tags, [Facebook OpenGraph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/opengraph) tags, [Sitemaps](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html) of your content, [Robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) bot directives, [Humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org) authorship accreditation, and as well as HTML meta tags.

SEOmatic populates your templates with SEO Meta in the same way that Craft populates your templates with `entry` variables, with a similar level of freedom and flexibility in terms of how you use them.

SEOmatic works automatically with Craft Commerce 2 as well, providing metadata, JSON-LD structured data, and sitemaps for your Products.

SEOmatic also caches each unique SEO Meta request so that your site performance is minimally impacted by the rich SEO Meta tags provided.
