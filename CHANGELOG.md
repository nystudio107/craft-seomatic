* Fixed an issue where using "Single Page" for the **Sitemap Page Size** setting would cause an exception to be thrown when generating the sitemap ([#1498](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-seomatic/issues/1498)) 

## 5.1.1 - 2024.07.19
### Changed
* Renamed the **Regenerate Sitemaps Automatically** setting to **Invalidate Sitemap Caches Automatically** for clarity

* Fixed an issue where saving an entry could be slow, because SEOmatic was pointlessly trying to regenerate the sitemap cache (which is no longer a thing with paginated sitemaps) ([#1494](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-seomatic/issues/1494))

## 5.1.0 - 2024.07.12
### Added
* Remove queue generated sitemaps, switch to paginated sitemaps to allow them to be rendered at web response time, but still be managable in size

* Added a setting in Plugin Settings -> Tags to specify which site should be used as the `x-default` for `hreflang` tags ([1162](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-seomatic/issues/1162))

### Changed
* Moved where paginated `hreflang` tags are added for paginated pages, so that they can be overriden via Twig templating code. They are now added inside of `seomatic.helper.paginate()`

* Fixed an issue where the `typeId` coming in from editing the Content SEO settings was a string, when it needed to be cast to an integer ([#1442](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-seomatic/issues/1442)) ([#1368](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-seomatic/issues/1368))
