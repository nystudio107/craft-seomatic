* SEOmatic SEO Settings fields do not utilize the Twigfield editor, to keep things simple for content authors (though they still parse as Twig expressions)
* Switched the default Twig expressions from single-bracket `{ }` to double-bracket `{{ }}` for consistency's sake in the `seomatic-config` settings (single-bracket expressions still work, however)
