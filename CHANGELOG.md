## 4.0.9 - 2022.10.03
### Changed
* Use `App::env()` to check environment ([#1210](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-seomatic/pull/1210))
* Added `CRAFT_ENVIRONMENT` check to `SeomaticVariable` ([#1210](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-seomatic/pull/1210))
* Don't bother invalidating sitemaps via the console command, as it causes them to be regenerated twice
* Use a stale-while-revalidate pattern for sitemap generation, so the old cached sitemap will be served until the new one as been regenerated due to an invalidation (content editing) ([#1213](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-seomatic/issues/1213))

* SEOmatic SEO Settings fields do not utilize the Twigfield editor, to keep things simple for content authors (though they still parse as Twig expressions)
* Switched the default Twig expressions from single-bracket `{ }` to double-bracket `{{ }}` for consistency's sake in the `seomatic-config` settings (single-bracket expressions still work, however)

### Changed
* The SEO Keywords field no longer uses a tokenized input, to allow for the use of the Twigfield editor
* Updated the docs to add **The Meta Cascade** to the **Overview** section to better explain how SEOmatic works

## 4.0.2 - 2022.06.18

### Fixed
* Don't allow the autocomplete object inspection to recurse infinitely, set a cap of 10 levels deep ([#1132](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-seomatic/issues/1132))

* Remove all `::craft3*` version static variables, and the conditional code they depend on
* Use the native `str_contains()` over `StringHelper::contains()` (which is slower, and allocated objects, etc.)

* Add `box-content` class on the code editors, to adjust for the new Tailwind CSS reset in v4
* Fixed an issue where none of the Site Settings changes could be saved ([#1107](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-seomatic/issues/1107))
