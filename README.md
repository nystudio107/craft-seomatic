Related: [SEOmatic for Craft 2.x](https://github.com/nystudio107/seomatic). SEOmatic for Craft CMS 3 is a complete re-write & re-architecture from scratch.

**Note**: _The license fee for this plugin is $99.00 via the Craft Plugin Store._

## Used By

![Screenshot](resources/img/moz-logo-blue.png)![Screenshot](resources/img/craft-cms-logo.png)

SEOmatic is the SEO tool that the SEO experts at [Moz.com](https://moz.com/) and the creators of Craft CMS, Pixel & Tonic, rely on to handle their SEO!

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.0.2 or later.

## Installation

To install SEOmatic, follow these steps:

1. Install with Composer via `composer require nystudio107/craft-seomatic`
2. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins

You can also install SEOmatic via the **Plugin Store** in the Craft AdminCP.

SEOmatic works on Craft 3.x.

## SEOmatic Usage Notes

### Issues

Please report any issues you find to the [SEOmatic Issues](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-seomatic/issues) page.

### Upgrading from SEOmatic 1.x for Craft CMS 2.x

If you are upgrading a site from Craft CMS 2.x to Craft CMS 3.x that used the older SEOmatic plugin, here's what you need to know.

SEOmatic will migrate your old Craft 2.x Field settings & data in the following ways:
 
 * The Content SEO settings for each Section where you had an old SEOmatic Meta FieldType will be migrated for you.
 
* If you add a new SEO Settings Field to a section that had an old SEOmatic Meta field in it, it will migrate any custom data you had entered on a per-Entry basis

**Important:** Keep your old Craft 2.x Seomatic_Meta fields intact; don't delete them or change the Field type to the new SEO Settings field type. Instead, create a new SEO Settings field in the same Section, Category Group, or Commerce Product Type. It will automatically look for and migrate data from the old Seomatic_Meta Field.

SEOmatic for Craft CMS 3 is a complete re-write and re-architecture from scratch of the plugin. This allowed us to take what we learned from SEOmatic 1.x, and rebuild it with a much more robust and extendable architecture.

If feasible, we think the best way to update sites using SEOmatic is to start fresh, and explore how the conceptual changes in the plugin affect how you use it. In most cases, you don't even need to use an SEOmatic Field, and the setup is cleaner and easier without it! We hope you love it!

**N.B.:** The Twig templating syntax has changed (but you may not need to use Twig at all with the new version), so give the docs a once-over.

## SEOmatic Overview

SEOmatic facilitates [modern SEO best practices](https://nystudio107.com/blog/modern-seo-snake-oil-vs-substance) & implementation for Craft CMS 3. It is a turnkey SEO system that is comprehensive, powerful, and flexible.

SEOmatic allows you to quickly get a website up and running with a robust, comprehensive SEO strategy.  It is also implemented in a Craft-y way, in that it is also flexible and customizable.

It implements [JSON-LD](https://developers.google.com/schemas/formats/json-ld?hl=en) microdata, [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview) tags, [Facebook OpenGraph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/opengraph) tags, [Sitemaps](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html) of your content, [Robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) bot directives, [Humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org) authorship accreditation, and as well as HTML meta tags.

SEOmatic populates your templates with SEO Meta in the same way that Craft populates your templates with `entry` variables, with a similar level of freedom and flexibility in terms of how you utilize them.

SEOmatic works automatically with Craft Commerce 2 as well, providing metadata, JSON-LD structured data, and sitemaps for your Products.

SEOmatic also caches each unique SEO Meta request so that your website performance is minimally impacted by the rich SEO Meta tags provided.

## Configuring SEOmatic

As soon as you install SEOmatic, it automatically will render meta data on your web pages, and create sitemaps for all of your Sections, Category Groups, and Commerce Product Types that have public URLs. You don't need to add any template code for this to happen.

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-multi-site.png)

All of SEOmatic's settings are multi-site aware, allowing you to have different settings for each site/language combination.

For SEOmatic to be truly useful, you need to configure it so that it knows where to _pull_ SEO content from.

### Dashboard

### Global SEO

**Global SEO** is where you set all of the default site-wide settings.

#### General

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-global-general.png)

Best practices for modern SEO are for the meta information to _reflect your content_, so you should set up the fields that SEOmatic _pulls_ the **SEO Title**, **SEO Description**, and **SEO Image** from.

#### Twitter

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-global-twitter.png)

By default, the Twitter and Facebook settings will mirror what you set in the **General** section, but you can customize them to your heart's content.

#### Facebook

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-global-facebook.png)

By default, the Twitter and Facebook settings will mirror what you set in the **General** section, but you can customize them to your heart's content.

#### Robots

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-global-robots.png)

A `robots.txt` file is a file at the root of your site that indicates those parts of your site you donâ€™t want accessed by search engine crawlers. The file uses the [Robots Exclusion Standard](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html), which is a protocol with a small set of commands that can be used to indicate access to your site by section and by specific kinds of web crawlers (such as mobile crawlers vs desktop crawlers).

You shouldn't need to edit the default `robots.txt` Template, but you can if you like.

SEOmatic automatically handles requests for `/robots.txt`. For this to work, make sure that you do not have an actual `robots.txt` file in your `web/` folder (because that will take precedence).

If you are running Nginx, make sure that you don't have a line like:

    location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    
...in your config file.  A directive like this will prevent SEOmatic from being able to service the request for `/robots.txt`.  If you do have a line like this in your config file, just comment it out, and restart Nginx with `sudo nginx -s reload`.

The **View robots.txt** button lets you view your `robots.txt`.

#### Humans

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-global-humans.png)

[Humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org/) is an initiative for knowing the people behind a website. It's a text file that contains information about the different people who have contributed to building the website. By adding a text file, you can prove your authorship (not your property) in an external, fast, easy and accessible way.

Feel free to edit the default `humans.txt` Template to your heart's content.

#### Global SEO AdminCP Fields

The fields in the AdminCP Global SEO settings are parsed as Twig object templates, so in addition to plain old text, you can also put single and double bracket Twig expressions.

This is entirely optional; in typical usage the controls you have in the AdminCP for pulling from other fields will be all you need. But the ability is there if you need it.

For example, the following will output the contents of the **companyInfo** field from the **siteInfo** Global:

```twig
{{ siteInfo.companyInfo }}
```

You can even do complex expressions, such as the following which outputs the first field that isn't empty, or a default text:

```twig
{{ siteInfo.companyInfo ?? siteInfo.companySummary ?? "Some default text" }}
```

You can also access SEOmatic global variables (discussed below):

```twig
{seomatic.meta.seoTitle}
```
Normal Twig double bracket syntax is supported too, but you'll need to preface it with `object.` for any `seomatic` variables:

```twig
{{ object.seomatic.meta.seoTitle }}
```
The single bracket syntax is just a shortcut that automatically prefixes any variables with `object.`, and it used for micro-template parsing.

### Content SEO

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-content.png)

**Content SEO** is where you can configure each Section, Category Group and Commerce Product Type that has public URLs. You'll see a list of all of your Sections, Category Groups, and Commerce Product Types that have public URLs, with status indicators letting you know what has been configured for each.

Click on a Section, Category Group, or Commerce Product Type name to edit its settings.

#### General

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-content-general.png)

Best practices for modern SEO are for the meta information to _reflect your content_, so you should set up the fields that SEOmatic _pulls_ the **SEO Title**, **SEO Description**, and **SEO Image** from.

#### Twitter

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-content-twitter.png)

By default, the Twitter and Facebook settings will mirror what you set in the **General** section, but you can customize them to your heart's content.

#### Facebook

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-content-facebook.png)

By default, the Twitter and Facebook settings will mirror what you set in the **General** section, but you can customize them to your heart's content.

#### Sitemap

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-content-sitemap.png)

SEOmatic automatically creates a sitemap index for each of your Site Groups. This sitemap index points to individual sitemaps for each of your Sections, Category Groups, and Commerce Product Types.

Instead of one massive sitemap that must be updated any time anything changes, only the sitemap for the Section, Category Group, or Commerce Product Type will be updated when something changes in it.

SEOmatic can automatically include files such as `.pdf`, `.xls`, `.doc` and other indexable file types in Asset fields or Asset fields in matrix blocks.

In addition, SEOmatic can automatically create [Image sitemaps](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/178636?hl=en) and [Video sitemaps](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/videosearch/sitemaps) from images & videos in Asset fields or Asset fields in matrix blocks

Sitemap Indexes are automatically submitted to search engines whenever a new Section, Category Group, or Commerce Product Type is added.

Section Sitemaps are automatically submitted to search engines whenever a new Element in that Section, Category Group, or Commerce Product Type is added.

If you have custom URLs that are not in the CMS, you can manually add them to their own Sitemap Index via **Site Settings** â†’ **Miscellaneous**.

You can also add to it via a plugin:

```php
use nystudio107\seomatic\events\RegisterSitemapUrlsEvent;
use nystudio107\seomatic\SitemapCustomTemplate;
use yii\base\Event;
Event::on(SitemapCustomTemplate::class, SitemapCustomTemplate::EVENT_REGISTER_SITEMAP_URLS, function(RegisterSitemapUrlsEvent $e) {
$e->sitemapUrls[] => [
         'loc' => $url,
         'changefreq' => $changeFreq,
         'priority' => $priority,
         'lastmod' => $lastMod,
     ];
 });
```

#### Content SEO AdminCP Fields

The fields in the AdminCP Content SEO settings are parsed as Twig object templates, so in addition to plain old text, you can also put single and double bracket Twig expressions.

This is entirely optional; in typical usage the controls you have in the AdminCP for pulling from other fields will be all you need. But the ability is there if you need it.

For example, the following will output the contents of the **description** field from the current **Entry**:

```twig
{entry.description}
```

Normal Twig double bracket syntax is supported too, but you'll need to preface it with `object.`:

```twig
{{ object.entry.description }}
```
The single bracket syntax is just a shortcut that automatically prefixes any variables with `object.`, and it used for micro-template parsing.

The same applies to any SEOmatic global variables (discussed below):

```twig
{seomatic.meta.seoTitle}
```
Is the same as:

```twig
{{ object.seomatic.meta.seoTitle }}
```

You can even do complex expressions, such as the following which outputs the first field that isn't empty, or a default text:

```twig
{entry.description ?? entry.summary ?? "Some default text"}
```
Is the same as:
```twig
{{ object.entry.description ?? object.entry.summary ?? "Some default text" }}
```

### Site Settings

#### Identity

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-site-identity.png)

These Site Identity settings are used to globally define the identity and ownership of the website.

They are used in combination with the SEO Template Meta settings to generate [JSON-LD](https://developers.google.com/schemas/formats/json-ld?hl=en) microdata.

The Site Owner type determines the JSON-LD schema that will be used to identity the website to search engines.

Leave any fields blank that aren't applicable or which you do not want as part of the SEO schema.

#### Creator

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-site-creator.png)

These Site Creator settings are used to globally define the _creator_ (such as the agency or freelancer) of the website.

They are used in combination with the SEO Template Meta settings to generate [JSON-LD](https://developers.google.com/schemas/formats/json-ld?hl=en) microdata as well as the `humans.txt` file.

The Site Creator type determines the JSON-LD schema that will be used to identity the website to search engines.

Leave any fields blank that aren't applicable or which you do not want as part of the SEO schema.

#### Social Media

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-site-social.png)

The social media settings connect your website to its other points of pressence on the Internet. They also facilitate attaching your branding to social media posts via Twitter Cards and Facebook OpenGraph.



### Tracking Scripts

None of the Tracking Scripts are included on the page unless the SEOmatic environment is set to `live` production. If `devMode` is enabled, the SEOmatic environment is automatically set to `local` development.

#### Google Analytics

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-tracking-ga.png)

Google Analytics gives you the digital analytics tools you need to analyze data from all touchpoints in one place, for a deeper understanding of the customer experience. You can then share the insights that matter with your whole organization. [Learn More](https://www.google.com/analytics/analytics/#?modal_active=none)

If you want to include the Google Analytics script despite `devMode` being enabled, you can do:

```twig
{% do seomatic.script.get('googleAnalytics').include(true) %}
```

#### Google `gtag.js`

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-tracking-gtag.png)

The global site tag (gtag.js) is a JavaScript tagging framework and API that allows you to send event data to AdWords, DoubleClick, and Google Analytics. Instead of having to manage multiple tags for different products, you can use gtag.js and more easily benefit from the latest tracking features and integrations as they become available. [Learn More](https://developers.google.com/gtagjs/)

If you want to include the gtag script despite `devMode` being enabled, you can do:

```twig
{% do seomatic.script.get('gtag').include(true) %}
```

#### Google Tag Manager

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-tracking-gtm.png)

Google Tag Manager is a tag management system that allows you to quickly and easily update tags and code snippets on your website. Once the Tag Manager snippet has been added to your website or mobile app, you can configure tags via a web-based user interface without having to alter and deploy additional code. [Learn More](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6102821?hl=en)

You can set the `dataLayer` passed in to Google Tag Manager via Twig:

```twig
{% do seomatic.script.get('googleTagManager').dataLayer({
    'woof': 'bark'
}) %}
```

If you want to include the Google Tag Manager script despite `devMode` being enabled, you can do:

```twig
{% do seomatic.script.get('googleTagManager').include(true) %}
```

#### Facebook Pixel

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-tracking-fb.png)

The Facebook pixel is an analytics tool that helps you measure the effectiveness of your advertising. You can use the Facebook pixel to understand the actions people are taking on your website and reach audiences you care about. [Learn More](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616)

If you want to include the Facebook Pixel script despite `devMode` being enabled, you can do:

```twig
{% do seomatic.script.get('facebookPixel').include(true) %}
```

#### Plugin Settings

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-plugin-settings.png)

The Plugin Settings lets you control various SEOmatic settings globally (across all sites/languages).

* **Plugin name** - This is the name that will be used for the plugin everywhere it is referenced in the AdminCP GUI
* **Automatic Render Enabled** - Controls whether SEOmatic will automatically render metadata on your pages. If you turn this off, you will need to manually render the metadata via `{{ seomatic.tag.render() }}`, `{{ seomatic.link.render() }}`, etc. You can selectively disable rendering via Twig with `{% do seomatic.config.renderEnabled(false) %}
* **Sitemaps Enabled** - Controls whether SEOmatic will automatically render frontend sitemaps for your website.
* **HTTP Headers Enabled** - Controls whether SEOmatic will automatically add `X-Robots-Tag`, `canonical`, & `Referrer-Policy` to the http response headers.
* **Environment** - The server environment, either `live`, `staging`, or `local`. If `devMode` is on, SEOmatic will override this setting to local Development. This setting controls whether certain things render; for instance only in the `live` production environment will Google Analytics and other tracking tags send analytics data. SEOmatic also automatically sets the `robots` tag to `none` for everything but the `live` production environment.
* **Display Sidebar SEO Preview** - Controls whether to display the Google, Twitter, and Facebook social media previews in the sidebar on entry. category, and product pages.
* **devMode `<title>` prefix** - If devMode is on, prefix the `<title>` with this string
* **Separator Character** - The separator character to use for the `<title>` tag
* **Max SEO Title Length** - The max number of characters in the <title> tag; anything beyond this will be truncated on word boundaries
* **Max SEO Description Length** - The max number of characters in the `meta description` tag
* **Generator Enabled** - Controls whether SEOmatic will include the meta `generator` tag and `X-Powered-By` header

If you're using a multi-environment config, you can map your environment settings using SEOmatic's `config.php` something like this:

```php
<?php 
return [
    '*' => [
    // The public-facing name of the plugin
    'pluginName' => 'SEOmatic',

    // Should SEOmatic render metadata?
    'renderEnabled' => true,

    // Should SEOmatic render frontend sitemaps?
    'sitemapsEnabled' => true,

    // The server environment, either `live`, `staging`, or `local`
    'environment' => 'live',

    // Should SEOmatic display the SEO Preview sidebar?
    'displayPreviewSidebar' => true,

    // Should SEOmatic display the SEO Analysis sidebar?
    'displayAnalysisSidebar' => true,

    // If `devMode` is on, prefix the <title> with this string
    'devModeTitlePrefix' => '&#x1f6a7; ',

    // The separator character to use for the `<title>` tag
    'separatorChar' => '|',

    // The max number of characters in the `<title>` tag
    'maxTitleLength' => 70,

    // The max number of characters in the `<meta name="description">` tag
    'maxDescriptionLength' => 320,
    ],
    'local' => [
        'environment' => 'local',
    ],
    'staging' => [
        'environment' => 'staging',
    ],
    'live' => [
        'environment' => 'live',
    ],
];
```
This is how you can make your multi-environment nomenclature to SEOmatic's. This works exactly like Craft's [multi-environment config](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/configuration.html#application-config) files such as `general.php` and `db.php`. See SEOmatic's `config.php` for details.

## SEOmatic Fields

### SEO Settings Field

SEOmatic has an SEO Settings Field that you can add to your Field Layouts. For most sites, the Field is not needed; instead set up the fields to pull from in the Content SEO settings for each Section.

Modern SEO works best if it actually reflects what is on the page, visible to the user, so pulling from your page's content will work well in most cases.

#### Using SEO Settings Fields

However, in some cases you may want more control over page SEO for specific entries. That's where the SEO Settings field comes in. Add it to your Section's Field Layout, and you can override specific SEO settings on a per-entry basis.

Any setting that you leave blank or empty in the SEO Settings field will just default to the Content SEO and/or Global SEO setting.

The Field settings let you control exactly what fields will appear and be visible for you or your client to override:

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-field-settings.png)

By default, just a few sensible settings are made visible in the Field:

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-field-defaults.png)

Any setting left blank will just fall back on the Content SEO settings for that Section, so you can use the Field only for the exceptional cases.

You can enable every possible field to be displayed in the SEO Settings field if you like:

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-field-full.png)

But it's probably best to limit it to just the things that you or your client might want to change on a per-entry basis.

#### Template Access

If you need to access your SEOmatic field's data directly in a template, you can do so via:

```twig
{{ entry.mySeoSettingsField.metaGlobalVars.seoTitle }}
```

All of the variables listed in the [General Variables](#general-variables) can be accessed in this manner.

## Pagination and SEO

If you are using paginated entries, you'll want to add some additional markup to your templates to make Google et al aware of this. Fortunately, SEOmatic makes that easy, you simply do:

```twig
{% do seomatic.helper.paginate(PAGEINFO) %}
```
 
 The `PAGEINFO` here is the variable from the `{% paginate %}` tag as [described here](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/templating/tags/paginate.html#the-pageInfo-variable), this will properly set the `canonicalUrl`, as well as adding the `<link rel='prev'>` and `<link rel='next'>` tags for you.

A complete example (just a modified version of the [Craft 3 Documentation on {% Paginate %}](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/templating/tags/paginate.html#the-pageInfo-variable)) might look like this:

```twig
{% paginate craft.entries.section('blog').limit(10) as pageInfo, pageEntries %}
{% do seomatic.helper.paginate(pageInfo) %}

{% for entry in pageEntries %}
    <article>
        <h1>{{ entry.title }}</h1>
        {{ entry.body }}
    </article>
{% endfor %}

{% if pageInfo.prevUrl %}<a href="{{ pageInfo.prevUrl }}">Previous Page</a>{% endif %}
{% if pageInfo.nextUrl %}<a href="{{ pageInfo.nextUrl }}">Next Page</a>{% endif %}
```
More info: [SEO Guide to Google Webmaster Recommendations for Pagination](https://moz.com/blog/seo-guide-to-google-webmaster-recommendations-for-pagination)

## Emoji Support

SEOmatic supports using Emojis in any of the fields in SEOmatic, so you could use one in the SEO Description, for instance:

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-emoji-support.png)

It's up to Google whether or not to display the emojis that you add to your SEO meta, but used effectively, they can help make your entries in the SERP stand out from others. Learn more: [Why Use Emojis in Your SEO / PPC Strategy?](https://www.jellyfish.net/en-us/news-and-views/why-use-emojis-in-your-seo-ppc-strategy)

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-mac-emoji-keyboard.png)

On the Mac, you can invoke an Emoji keyboard inside of any text field by hitting Command Control Space. This works in any Mac application, not just web browsers or SEOmatic.

## Google AMP Support

SEOmatic works great with [Google AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/)! In fact, it will provide the [JSON-LD structured data](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/fundamentals/spec) that is _required_ by the AMP spec.

Since AMP [doesn't allow for third-party JavaScript](https://medium.com/google-developers/how-to-avoid-common-mistakes-when-publishing-accelerated-mobile-pages-9ea61abf530f), you might want to add this to your AMP templates:
```twig
{% do seomatic.script.container().include(false) %}
```

This will cause SEOmatic to not render _any_ custom scripts you might have enabled (such as Google Analytics, gtag, etc.)

## Single Page App (SPA) Support

SEOmatic fully supports working with SPAs, allowing you to receive the metadata needed for a given route either as an array, or as DOM elements ready to be inserted.

See the **Headless SPA API** section for details.

## Using SEOmatic

### Twig Templating

SEOmatic can work fully without any Twig templating code at all. However, it provides a robust API that you can tap into from your Twig templates should you desire to do so.

SEOmatic makes a global `seomatic` variable available in your Twig templates that allows you to work with the SEOmatic variables and functions.

#### SEOmatic Variables

All of the SEOmatic variables can be accessed as you would any normal Twig variable:

```twig
{{ seomatic.meta.seoTitle }}
```
or
```twig
{% set title = seomatic.meta.seoTitle %}
```

They can also be changed by passing in a value with the Twig `{% do %}` syntax:

```twig
{% do seomatic.meta.seoTitle("Some Title") %}
```
or
```twig
{% do seomatic.meta.seoDescription("This is my description. There are many like it, but this one is mine.") %}
```

You can also set multiple variables at once using array syntax:

```twig
{% do seomatic.meta.setAttributes({
  "seoTitle": "Some Title",
  "seoDescription": "This is my description. There are many like it, but this one is mine."
  })
%}
```

Or you can chain them together:


```twig
{% do seomatic.meta
  .seoTitle("Some Title")
  .seoDescription("This is my description. There are many like it, but this one is mine.")
%}
```

These do the same thing, so use whichever you prefer.

You can set SEOmatic variables anywhere in your templates, even in sub-templates you `include` from other templates. This works because SEOmatic dynamically injects the meta tags, scripts, links, and JSON-LD into your page after the template is done rendering.

SEOmatic variables can also reference other SEOmatic variables using single-bracket syntax:

 ```twig
 {% do seomatic.meta.seoDescription("{seomatic.meta.seoTitle}") %}
 ```

You can also reference `entry`, `category`, or `product` Craft variables, if they are present in your template:

 ```twig
 {% do seomatic.meta.seoTitle("{entry.title}") %}
 ```
or
```twig
 {% do seomatic.meta.seoTitle("{category.title}") %}
```

There may be occasions where you want to output the final parsed value of an SEOmatic variable on the frontend. You can do that via `seomatic.meta.parsedValue()`. For example:

```twig
{{ seomatic.meta.parsedValue('seoDescription') }}
```

This will output the final parsed value of the `seomatic.meta.seoDescription` variable.

This parsing is done automatically by SEOmatic just before the meta information is added to your page.

#### Meta Variables: `seomatic.meta`

The `seomatic.meta` variable contains all of the meta variables that control the SEO that will be rendered on the site. They are pre-populated from your settings and content in the AdminCP, but you can change them as you see fit.

##### General Variables:

The `seomatic.config` variables are the global plugin configuration variables set in the `config.php` file. You can copy the `config.php` file to the Craft `config/` directory as `seomatic.php` to change them in a multi-environment friendly way.

* **`seomatic.config.pluginName`** - The public-facing name of the plugin
* **`seomatic.config.renderEnabled`** - Should SEOmatic render metadata?
* **`seomatic.config.environment`** - The server environment, either `live`, `staging`, or `local`

* **`seomatic.config.maxTitleLength`** - The max number of characters in the `<title>` tag
* **`seomatic.config.maxDescriptionLength`** - The max number of characters in the `<meta name="description">` tag

#### Helper Functions `seomatic.helper`

* **`seomatic.helper.paginate(PAGEINFO)`** - Given the `PAGEINFO` variable from the `{% paginate %}` tag as [described here](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/templating/tags/paginate.html#the-pageInfo-variable), this will properly set the `canonicalUrl`, as well as adding the `<link rel='prev'>` and `<link rel='next'>` tags for you.
* **`seomatic.helper.truncate(TEXT, LENGTH, SUBSTR)`** - Truncates the `TEXT` to a given `LENGTH`. If `SUBSTR` is provided, and truncating occurs, the string is further truncated so that the substring may be appended without exceeding the desired length.
* **`seomatic.helper.truncateOnWord(TEXT, LENGTH, SUBSTR)`** - Truncates the `TEXT` to a given `LENGTH`, while ensuring that it does not split words. If `SUBSTR` is provided, and truncating occurs, the string is further truncated so that the substring may be appended without exceeding the desired length.
* **`seomatic.helper.getLocalizedUrls(URI, SITE_ID)`** - Return a list of localized URLs for a given `URI` that are in the `SITE_ID` site's group. Both `URI` and `SITE_ID` are optional, and will use the current request's `URI` and the current site's `SITE_ID` if omitted.
* **`seomatic.helper.loadMetadataForUri(URI, SITE_ID)`** - Load the appropriate meta containers for the given `URI` and optional `SITE_ID`
* **`seomatic.helper.sitemapIndexForSiteId(SITE_ID)`** - Get the URL to the `SITE_ID`s sitemap index
* **`seomatic.helper.extractTextFromField(FIELD)`** - Extract plain text from a PlainText, Redactor, CKEdtior, Tags, or Matrix field
* **`seomatic.helper.extractKeywords(TEXT, LIMIT)`** - Extract up to `LIMIT` most important keywords from `TEXT`
* **`seomatic.helper.extractSummary(TEXT)`** - Extract the most important 3 sentences from `TEXT`
* **`seomatic.helper.socialTransform(ASSET, TRANSFORMNAME)`** - Transform the `ASSET` (either an Asset or an Asset ID) for social media sites in `TRANSFORMNAME`; valid values are `base`, `facebook`, `twitter-summary`, and `twitter-large`
* **`seomatic.helper.seoFileLink(FILE_URL, ROBOTS, CANONICAL, INLINE)`** - Generates a link to a local or remote file that allows you to set the `X-Robots-Tag` header via `ROBOTS` (defaults to `all`) and `Link` canonical header via `CANONICAL` (defaults to `''`) as per [Advanced rel="canonical" HTTP Headers](https://moz.com/blog/how-to-advanced-relcanonical-http-headers). `INLINE` controls whether the file will be displayed inline or downloaded. If any values are empty `''`, the headers will not be included.

#### SEOmatic Tags & Containers

All of the SEOmatic tags, links, scripts, title, and JSON-LD are meta objects that have their values set from the `seomatic.meta` variables.

These meta objects know what properties they should have, and can self-validate. If `devMode` is on, you can check the Yii2 Debug Toolbar's Log to see any validation warnings or errors with your tags.

All of SEOmatic's meta objects are stored in containers, and they can be accessed and manipulated directly. You can even dynamically create new tags via Twig at template render time.

All of the meta object (tags, scripts, links, title, and JSON-LD) have the same API to make it easy to use.

##### Meta Object `.get()`
```twig
{% set descriptionTag = seomatic.tag.get("description") %}
```
...will return the `<meta name="description">` meta object to you in `descriptionTag`.

##### Meta Object Properties

You can access meta object properties just like you can any Twig variable:

```twig
{{ descriptionTag.content }}
```
or
```twig
{% set myContent = seomatic.meta.seoTitle %}
```

They can also be changed by passing in a value with the Twig `{% do %}` syntax:


```twig
{% do descriptionTag.content("Some description") %}
```

All meta objects also have an `include` property that determines whether or not they should be included on your web page:

```twig
{% do descriptionTag.include(false) %}
```

You could also chain this together in a single line:
```twig
{% do seomatic.tag.get("description").include(false) %}
```

And you can set multiple attributes at once using an array syntax:

```twig
{% do seomatic.tag.get("description").setAttributes({
  "content": "Some Description",
  "include": false
  })
%}
```

Which is the same as doing:


```twig
{% do seomatic.tag.get("description")
  .content("Some Description")
  .include(false)
%}
```

So use whatever you like better.

##### Meta Object `.create()`

To create a new meta object, you pass in a key:value array of the attributes to use when creating it:

```twig
{% set linkTag = seomatic.link.create({
  "rel": "canonical",
  "content": "https://nystudio107.com"
  })
%}
```

By default, newly created meta objects are added to the appropriate meta container, so they will be rendered on the page. Should you wish to create a meta object but _not_ have it added to a container, you can pass in an optional `false` parameter:

```twig
{% set linkTag = seomatic.link.create({
  "rel": "canonical",
  "content": "https://nystudio107.com"
  }, false)
%}
```

##### Meta Object Validation

All meta objects can self-validate:
```twig
{% set myJsonLd = seomatic.jsonLd.create({
    'type': 'Article',
    'name': 'Some Blog',
    'url': 'woopsie',
}) %}

{% if myJsonLd.validate() %}
    <p>Valid!</p>
{% else %}
    <ul>
        {% for param,errors in myJsonLd.errors %}
            <li>
                {{ param ~ " " }}
                <ul>
                    {% for error in errors %}
                        <li>
                            {{ error ~ " " }}
                        </li>
                    {% endfor %}
                </ul>
            </li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% endif %}
```

This will output:

* url
  * Must be one of these types: URL

Which tells you that the `url` parameter is invalid.  The default validation just ensures that all of the properties are correct.

You can also set the _scenario_ to display properties that Google requires/recommends:

```twig
{% set myJsonLd = seomatic.jsonLd.create({
    'type': 'Article',
    'name': 'Some Blog',
    'url': 'woopsie',
}) %}

{% do myJsonLd.setScenario('google') %}

{% if myJsonLd.validate() %}
    <p>Valid!</p>
{% else %}
    <ul>
        {% for param,errors in myJsonLd.errors %}
            <li>
                {{ param ~ " " }}
                <ul>
                    {% for error in errors %}
                        <li>
                            {{ error ~ " " }}
                        </li>
                    {% endfor %}
                </ul>
            </li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% endif %}
```

This will output:

* url
  * Must be one of these types: URL
* image
  * This property is recommended by Google.
* author
  * This property is required by Google.
* datePublished
  * This property is required by Google.
* headline
  * This property is required by Google.
* publisher
  * This property is required by Google.
* mainEntityOfPage
  * This property is recommended by Google.
* dateModified
  * This property is recommended by Google.

If the website has `devMode` on, all of the meta objects are automatically validated as they are rendered, with the results displayed in the Yii Debug Toolbar. The Yii Debug Toolbar can be enabled in your account settings page.

#### JSON-LD Meta Object Functions `seomatic.jsonLd`

* **`seomatic.jsonLd.get(META_HANDLE)`** Returns the JSON-LD meta object of the handle `META_HANDLE` or `null` if it is not found
* **`seomatic.jsonLd.create()`** Creates a JSON-LD meta object from an array of key/value properties. The `type` can be any of the [Schema.org](https://schema.org/docs/full.html) types.
* **`seomatic.jsonLd.add(META_OBJECT)`** Adds the `META_OBJECT` to the JSON-LD container to be rendered
* **`seomatic.jsonLd.render()`** Renders all of the JSON-LD meta objects to your template. This is only needed if you have turned off **Automatic Render** in Plugin Settings
* **`seomatic.jsonLd.container()`** Returns the container that holds an array of all of the JSON-LD meta objects

##### JSON-LD Meta Object Examples:

Create a new [Article](https://schema.org/Article) JSON-LD meta object:
```twig
{% set myJsonLd = seomatic.jsonLd.create({
    'type': 'Article',
    'name': 'Some Blog',
    'url': 'https://nystudio107.com/blog',
}) %}
```

Get the existing **MainEntityOfPage** as set in the Global SEO or Content SEO AdminCP section to modify it (schema.org: [mainEntityOfPage](https://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html#mainEntityBackground)):
```twig
{% set mainEntity = seomatic.jsonLd.get('mainEntityOfPage') %}
```

Get the existing **BreadcrumbList** as generated automatically by SEOmatic to modify them (schema.org: [BreadcrumbList](https://schema.org/BreadcrumbList)):
```twig
{% set crumbs = seomatic.jsonLd.get('breadcrumbList') %}
```

Display the breadcrumbs on the page:

```twig
{% set crumbList = seomatic.jsonLd.get('breadcrumbList').itemListElement %}
{% for crumb in crumbList %}
    <a href="{{ crumb.item['@id'] }}">{{ crumb.item['name'] }}</a>
    {% if not loop.last %}&raquo;{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```

Get the existing **Identity** as set in the Site Settings AdminCP section to modify it:
```twig
{% set identity = seomatic.jsonLd.get('identity') %}
```

Get the existing **Creator** as set in the Site Settings AdminCP section to modify it:
```twig
{% set identity = seomatic.jsonLd.get('creator') %}
```

#### Link Meta Object Functions `seomatic.link`

* **`seomatic.link.get(META_HANDLE)`** Returns the Link meta object of the handle `META_HANDLE` or `null` if it is not found
* **`seomatic.link.create(CONFIG_ARRAY)`** Creates a Link meta object from an array of key/value properties
* **`seomatic.link.add(META_OBJECT)`** Adds the `META_OBJECT` to the Link container to be rendered
* **`seomatic.link.render()`** Renders all of the Link meta objects to your template. This is only needed if you have turned off **Automatic Render** in Plugin Settings
* **`seomatic.link.container()`** Returns the container that holds an array of all of the Link meta objects

##### Link Meta Object Examples:

Change the `<link rel="canonical">`:
```twig
{% do seomatic.link.get("canonical").href("https://nystudio107.com") %}
```

Note that you can achieve the same result with:
```twig
{% do seomatic.meta.canonicalUrl("https://nystudio107.com") %}
```

...since the `canonicalUrl` populates the `<link rel="canonical">` Link meta object

#### Script Meta Object Functions `seomatic.script`

* **`seomatic.script.get(META_HANDLE)`** Returns the Script meta object of the handle `META_HANDLE` or `null` if it is not found 
* **`seomatic.script.create()`** Creates a Script meta object from an array of key/value properties
* **`seomatic.script.add(META_OBJECT)`** Adds the `META_OBJECT` to the Script container to be rendered
* **`seomatic.script.render()`** Renders all of the Script meta objects to your template. This is only needed if you have turned off **Automatic Render** in Plugin Settings
* **`seomatic.script.container()`** Returns the container that holds an array of all of the Script meta objects

##### Script Meta Object Examples:

Don't include the Google Analytics script on the page:
```twig
{% do seomatic.script.get("googleAnalytics").include(false) %}
```

#### Tag Meta Object Functions `seomatic.tag`

* **`seomatic.tag.get(META_HANDLE)`** Returns the Tag meta object of the handle `META_HANDLE` or `null` if it is not found
* **`seomatic.tag.create()`** Creates a Tag meta object from an array of key/value properties
* **`seomatic.tag.add(META_OBJECT)`** Adds the `META_OBJECT` to the Tag container to be rendered
* **`seomatic.tag.render()`** Renders all of the Tag meta objects to your template. This is only needed if you have turned off **Automatic Render** in Plugin Settings
* **`seomatic.tag.container()`** Returns the container that holds an array of all of the Tag meta objects

##### Tag Meta Object Examples:

Change the `<meta name="twitter:title">`:

```twig
{% do seomatic.tag.get("twitter:title").content("Hello, world") %}
```

Note that you can achieve the same result with:
```twig
{% do seomatic.meta.twitterTitle("Hello, world") %}
```

...since the `twitterTitle` populates the `<meta name="twitter:title">` Tag meta object by default.

Let's say you didn't want Google et al to index a particular page or under certain conditions. You could do this:

```twig
{% do seomatic.tag.get("robots").content("none") %}
```

Note that you can achieve the same result with:
```twig
{% do seomatic.meta.robots("none") %}
```

...since the `robots` populates the `<meta name="robots">` Tag meta object by default.

#### Title Meta Object Functions `seomatic.title`

* **`seomatic.title.get(META_HANDLE)`** Returns the Title meta object of the handle `META_HANDLE` or `null` if it is not found
* **`seomatic.title.create()`** Creates a Title meta object from an array of key/value properties
* **`seomatic.title.add(META_OBJECT)`** Adds the `META_OBJECT` to the Title container to be rendered
* **`seomatic.title.render()`** Renders Title meta object to your template. This is only needed if you have turned off **Automatic Render** in Plugin Settings
* **`seomatic.title.container()`** Returns the container that holds an array with the Title meta object in it

##### Tag Meta Object Examples:

Change the `<title>`:

```twig
{% do seomatic.title.get("title").content("My page title") %}
```

Note that you can achieve the same result with:
```twig
{% do seomatic.meta.seoTitle("My page title") %}
```

...since the `seoTitle` populates the `<title">` Title meta object

## Config File Customization

### Config Settings

SEOmatic supports the standard `config.php` multi-environment friendly config file for the plugin settings. Just copy the `config.php` to your Craft `config/` directory as `seomatic.php` and you can configure the settings in a multi-environment friendly way.

These are the same settings that are configured in the **Plugin Settings** in the AdminCP.

### Meta Bundle / Container Settings

The directory `vendor/nystudio107/seomatic/src/seomatic-config` contains a number of files that are used when initially configuring SEOmatic.

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/seomatic-seomatic-config.png)

You can copy this entire directory to your Craft `config/` directory, and customize the files to your heart's content. SEOmatic will first look in the `config/` directory for any given file, and then fall back on its own internal `seomatic-config` files.

Note that these files are only used when initially creating a meta bundle. That is, whenever the plugin is installed, or new Section, Category Groups, or Commerce Product Types are created. Once meta bundles have been created, changing the settings in the file will have no effect.

You can bump the `Bundle.php`'s `bundleVersion` setting if you want it to re-read your config settings.

## Headless SPA API

SEOmatic allows you to fetch the meta information for any page via a controller API endpoint, so you can render the meta data via a frontend framework like VueJS or React.

### Meta Container API Endpoints

To get all of the meta containers for a given URI, the controller action is:

```twig
/actions/seomatic/meta-container/all-meta-containers/?uri=/
```
...where `uri` is the path to obtain the meta information from.

This will return to you an array of meta containers, with the render-ready meta tags in each:

```json
{
    "MetaTitleContainer": "<title>[devMode] Craft3 | Homepage</title>",
    "MetaTagContainer": "<meta name=\"generator\" content=\"SEOmatic\"><meta name=\"referrer\" content=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\"><meta name=\"robots\" content=\"all\">",
    "MetaLinkContainer": "<link href=\"http://craft3.test/\" rel=\"canonical\"><link type=\"text/plain\" href=\"/humans.txt\" rel=\"author\"><link href=\"http://craft3.test/\" rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"es\">",
    "MetaScriptContainer": "",
    "MetaJsonLdContainer": "<script type=\"application/ld+json\">{\"@context\":\"http://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"image\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"height\":\"804\",\"width\":\"1200\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en-us\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"http://craft3.test/\",\"name\":\"Homepage\",\"url\":\"http://craft3.test/\"}</script><script type=\"application/ld+json\">{\"@context\":\"http://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"description\":\"Breadcrumbs list\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"item\":{\"@id\":\"http://craft3.test/\",\"name\":\"Homepage\"},\"position\":1}],\"name\":\"Breadcrumbs\"}</script>"
}
```

Should you wish to have the items in the meta containers return as an array of data instead, you can do that with the optional `asArray=true` parameter:

```
/actions/seomatic/meta-container/all-meta-containers/?uri=/&asArray=true
```

Which will return the data in array form:
```json
{
    "MetaTitleContainer": {
        "title": {
            "title": "[devMode] Craft3 | Homepage"
        }
    },
    "MetaTagContainer": {
        "generator": {
            "content": "SEOmatic",
            "name": "generator"
        },
        "referrer": {
            "content": "no-referrer-when-downgrade",
            "name": "referrer"
        },
        "robots": {
            "content": "all",
            "name": "robots"
        }
    },
    "MetaLinkContainer": {
        "canonical": {
            "href": "http://craft3.test/",
            "rel": "canonical"
        },
        "author": {
            "href": "/humans.txt",
            "rel": "author",
            "type": "text/plain"
        },
        "alternate": {
            "href": "http://craft3.test/",
            "hreflang": "es",
            "rel": "alternate"
        }
    },
    "MetaScriptContainer": [],
    "MetaJsonLdContainer": {
        "WebPage": {
            "@context": "http://schema.org",
            "@type": "WebPage",
            "image": {
                "@type": "ImageObject",
                "height": "804",
                "width": "1200"
            },
            "inLanguage": "en-us",
            "mainEntityOfPage": "http://craft3.test/",
            "name": "Homepage",
            "url": "http://craft3.test/"
        },
        "BreadcrumbList": {
            "@context": "http://schema.org",
            "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
            "description": "Breadcrumbs list",
            "itemListElement": [
                {
                    "@type": "ListItem",
                    "item": {
                        "@id": "http://craft3.test/",
                        "name": "Homepage"
                    },
                    "position": 1
                }
            ],
            "name": "Breadcrumbs"
        }
    }
}
```

You can also request individual meta containers.

Title container:

```
/actions/seomatic/meta-container/meta-title-container/?uri=/
```

...will return just the Title container:
```json
{
    "MetaTitleContainer": "<title>[devMode] Craft3 | Homepage</title>"
}
```

Tag container:

```
/actions/seomatic/meta-container/meta-tag-container/?uri=/
```

...will return just the Tag container:
```json
{
     "MetaTagContainer": "<meta name=\"generator\" content=\"SEOmatic\"><meta name=\"referrer\" content=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\"><meta name=\"robots\" content=\"all\">"
 }
```

Script container:

```
/actions/seomatic/meta-container/meta-script-container/?uri=/
```

...will return just the Script container:
```json
{
    "MetaScriptContainer": ""
}
```

Link container:

```
/actions/seomatic/meta-container/meta-link-container/?uri=/
```

...will return just the Link container:
```json
{
    "MetaLinkContainer": "<link href=\"http://craft3.test/\" rel=\"canonical\"><link type=\"text/plain\" href=\"/humans.txt\" rel=\"author\"><link href=\"http://craft3.test/\" rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"es\">"
}
```

JSON-LD container:

```
/actions/seomatic/meta-container/meta-json-ld-container/?uri=/
```

...will return just the JSON-LD container:
```json
{
    "MetaJsonLdContainer": "<script type=\"application/ld+json\">{\"@context\":\"http://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"image\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"height\":\"804\",\"width\":\"1200\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en-us\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"http://craft3.test/\",\"name\":\"Homepage\",\"url\":\"http://craft3.test/\"}</script><script type=\"application/ld+json\">{\"@context\":\"http://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"description\":\"Breadcrumbs list\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"item\":{\"@id\":\"http://craft3.test/\",\"name\":\"Homepage\"},\"position\":1}],\"name\":\"Breadcrumbs\"}</script>"
}
```

All of the individual container controller API endpoints also accept the `&asArray=true` parameter if you'd like the data in array form.
 
### Schema.org API Endpoints

To get a key/value array of a given [Schema.org](https://schema.org/docs/full.html) type:

```
/actions/seomatic/json-ld/get-type?schemaType=Article
```

To get a decomposed version of a given [Schema.org](https://schema.org/docs/full.html) type, with the properties grouped by each inherited type:

```
/actions/seomatic/json-ld/get-decomposed-type?schemaType=Article
```

To get a hierarchical array of all of the schema types: 

```
/actions/seomatic/json-ld/get-type-array?path=Article
```

You can narrow this down to a specific sub-type list by passing in a `path` of schema types delimited by a `.`:
```
/actions/seomatic/json-ld/get-type-array?path=CreativeWork.Article
```
...this would output all of the sub-types of `Article`:
```
{
  "AdvertiserContentArticle": "AdvertiserContentArticle",
  "NewsArticle": {
    "AnalysisNewsArticle": "AnalysisNewsArticle",
    "BackgroundNewsArticle": "BackgroundNewsArticle",
    "OpinionNewsArticle": "OpinionNewsArticle",
    "ReportageNewsArticle": "ReportageNewsArticle",
    "ReviewNewsArticle": "ReviewNewsArticle"
  },
  "Report": "Report",
  "SatiricalArticle": "SatiricalArticle",
  "ScholarlyArticle": {
    "MedicalScholarlyArticle": "MedicalScholarlyArticle"
  },
  "SocialMediaPosting": {
    "BlogPosting": {
      "LiveBlogPosting": "LiveBlogPosting"
    },
    "DiscussionForumPosting": "DiscussionForumPosting"
  },
  "TechArticle": {
    "APIReference": "APIReference"
  }
}
```
