/**
 * CreativeWorkSeries - A CreativeWorkSeries in schema.org is a group of
 * related items, typically but not necessarily of the same kind.
 * CreativeWorkSeries are usually organized into some order, often
 * chronological. Unlike ItemList which is a general purpose data structure
 * for lists of things, the emphasis with CreativeWorkSeries is on published
 * materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such as tv, radio
 * and games). Specific subtypes are available for describing TVSeries,
 * RadioSeries, MovieSeries, BookSeries, Periodical and VideoGameSeries. In
 * each case, the hasPart / isPartOf properties can be used to relate the
 * CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries type serves
 * largely just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes. It is
 * common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be usefully
 * applied to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate some of
 * these cases, but publishers should be free to apply properties of the
 * series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate.
